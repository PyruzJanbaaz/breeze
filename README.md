# Breeze
Breeze is a task management system based on blockchain technology.
  
Breeze is an MVP of the task management system. Using Breeze, we can create a new project and make tasks with 4 states (TODO, DOING, REVIEW, DONE). 
The projects can have budgets, so any task which is created by the owner, can have a price. The owner of the project is able to increase the budget of the project whenever he/she wants. also, he/she can update the price of the tasks.

On the other hand, developers can compare the projects and select projects for contribution after registering. That means developers can earn ETH by doing the task.
"DONE" the state will be done just by the owner of the project, so after changing the state of a task to "DONE" the amount of the task will be paid to the developer by using the smart contract of the Breeze.
